# Statistics of acceptance rates of the main evolutionary computation conferences

A web site version of this repository is [here](https://ryojitanabe.github.io/ecconf/). This web site provides statistics of acceptance rates of the main evolutionary computation conferences for my own interest. Since I collected data manually, some statistics may be incorrect. If you found some errors, please email me ([Ryoji Tanabe](https://ryojitanabe.github.io/), rt.ryoji.tanabe [at] gmail.com) or send a pull request.

I used [the CSV To Markdown Table Generator](https://donatstudios.com/CsvToMarkdownTable) to convert a CSV file in the directory "data" to a markdown format.
