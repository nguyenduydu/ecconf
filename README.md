# Statistics of acceptance rate for evolutionary computation conferences

A web site version of this repository is [here](https://ryojitanabe.github.io/ecconf/). This repository provides statistics of acceptance rate for the main evolutionary computation conferences for my own interest. Since I collected data manually, some statistics may be incorrect. If you found some errors, please email me (Ryoji Tanabe, rt.ryoji.tanabe [at] gmail.com) or send a pull request.
